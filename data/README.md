# DATA

These multiple source data are used because we don't find any database with varied data.
All databases had their records trimmed before 2018 to reduce the size of the final database. Since the work is basically a proof of concept, I think this will be enough.
So there is a little description of the databases:
Taylor Swift Concerts:
    This is a database with some information about Taylor Swift's concerts. Some cuts and other manipulations were made to this database to obtain the Json version.

Metallica Concerts: 
        This is a database with some information about Metallica's concerts. Some cuts and other manipulations were made to this database to obtain the json version.
